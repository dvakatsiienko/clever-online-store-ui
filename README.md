# Online Store Sickfits UI

An application is built with the following technology solutions:

🖥 &nbsp; **Frontend**:

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
-   [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
-   [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

📡 &nbsp; **Backend**:

-   [Keystone](https://next.keystonejs.com/) — headless CMS and GraphQL API
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) — database solution
-   [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) — emailing solution
-   [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) — payment solution
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

The backend source code for the application [is dislocated here](https://github.com/dvakatsiienko/online-store-sickfits-api).

An application is based on my [Next.js starter kit](https://github.com/dvakatsiienko/next-launchpad)(so-called **next-launchpad**), take a look, and use it if you will. 😁

The application model is taken from [Wes Bos Advanced React course © (give him a credit)](https://github.com/wesbos/Advanced-React) and tweaked a little bit. 😉

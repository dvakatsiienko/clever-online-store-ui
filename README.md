# Online Store Sickfits UI

An application is built with the following technology solutions:

🖥 **Frontend**:

-   Next.js
-   Apollo GraphQL Client
-   styled-components
-   Typescript

📡 **Backend**:

-   KeystoneJS
-   MongoDB
-   Stripe (payment service)
-   Typescript

The backend source code for the application [is dislocated here](https://github.com/dvakatsiienko/online-store-sickfits-api).

An application is based on my [Next.js starter kit](https://github.com/dvakatsiienko/next-launchpad)(so-called **next-launchpad**), take a look, and use it if you will. 😁

# Online Store Sickfits UI

An application is built with the following technology solutions:

🖥 &nbsp; **Frontend**:

-   Next.js
-   Apollo Client
-   styled-components
-   react-hook-form
-   Typescript

📡 &nbsp; **Backend**:

-   Keystone — headless CMS and GraphQL API
-   MongoDB — database solution
-   Nodemailer — emailing solution
-   Stripe — payment solution
-   Typescript

The backend source code for the application [is dislocated here](https://github.com/dvakatsiienko/online-store-sickfits-api).

An application is based on my [Next.js starter kit](https://github.com/dvakatsiienko/next-launchpad)(so-called **next-launchpad**), take a look, and use it if you will. 😁
